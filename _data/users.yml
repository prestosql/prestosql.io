    Amazon AWS is a widely used for deploying and running Trino. The Amazon EMR
    product provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast, and
    cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable
    Amazon EC2 instances. With EMR, you can launch a large Trino cluster in
    minutes. You don’t need to worry about node provisioning, cluster setup or
    tuning. Using Trino on EMR provides you cluster elasticity. You can
    provision one, hundreds, or thousands of compute instances to process data
    at any scale. The scaling can be manual or automatic, and you only pay for
    what you use. Pricing is simple and predictable. You pay a per-second rate
    for every second used, with a one-minute minimum charge.
