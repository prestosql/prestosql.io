First time Trino blogger, long time lurker on the Trino slack. My name is 
[Rose Williams](https://twitter.com/ZelWms) and I’m an open source docs enthusiast! 
I’ve had the pleasure of contributing to this community for the past few months. 
Recently I’ve been working with [Brian Olsen](https://twitter.com/bitsondatadev), our fearless 
developer advocate, as well as some of our other Trino doc contributors, to get 
Trino ready for the Write the Docs [Writing Day](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/writing-day/) open source event!

If you’re not familiar with [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org), it’s
a global community of people who care about documentation. 

> “We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their
> users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers,
> developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
> people to have great experiences with software.”

[Writing Day](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/writing-day/) is
the first day of their upcoming virtual documentation conference, [Write the
Docs Portland (PST)](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/) April
25-27, 2021. The goal of Writing Day is to get a bunch of interesting people in
a room together and introduce them to cool open source projects that they can
onboard and contribute to.

Writing Day is open to all conference attendees and several Trino enthusiasts are
attending as mentors. Leading up to the conference, we're focused on identifying
docs issues that are ideal for first time contributors. If you’re a regular
Trino contributor, you might notice that we’re going through and tagging items
as “good first issue” and “docs” - we’ll be using those tags to create an 
[issues filter](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Adocs+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 
for the event. We’re also doing some work on the Trino docs readme to
help folks onboard faster.

[Snag a ticket](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/tickets/) if
you’re interested in participating, we hope to see you there! Our goal is to
continue curating good first issues for future writers and developers.
