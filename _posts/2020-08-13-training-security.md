All the useful and fast running queries your created with the knowledge from
[David's training about advanced SQL]({% post_url
2020-07-09-training-advanced-sql %}) and [Martin's training about query
tuning]({% post_url 2020-07-09-training-advanced-sql %}) created a problem. You
now have lots of users on your Presto cluster that want to access all sorts of
different data source, have different privileges and corporate security asked
about your plans. How about you tap into some help from Dain:

Join us for a free webinar **Understanding and Tuning Presto Query Processing**
with Dain Sundstrom.

In our new [Presto Training Series](https://bit.ly/2NO26Cm) we give Presto users
an opportunity to learn advanced skills from the co-creators of Presto â€“
[David Phillips](https://github.com/electrum), 
[Martin Traverso](https://github.com/martint) and 
[Dain Sundstrom](https://github.com/dain). Beyond the basics, each of the four 
training sessions covers critical topics for scaling Presto to more users and
use cases. 

In this training session Dain teaches you how to securely deploy Presto at
scale. We cover how to secure Presto itself, access to Presto, and access to
your underlying data. This session covers the following topics:

* Presto authentication, including password & LDAP Authentication
* Authorization to access your data sources
* Encryption including Presto client-to-coordinator communication
* Secure communication in the cluster
* Support for Kerberos
* Secrets usage for configuration files including catalogs
