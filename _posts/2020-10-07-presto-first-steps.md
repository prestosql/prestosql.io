Writing the book [Presto: The Definitive
Guide](/presto-the-definitive-guide.html) with Matt and Martin earlier this
year, and then publishing it with [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) was a
great experience and has been a great success. Lots of readers took advantage of
getting a [free digital copy of the book from Starburst]({% post_url

Now it is time to follow up with a training class. I am pleased to let you know
that you can join me for three hours of
[Presto First Steps](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/presto-first-steps/0636920462859/)
in November.

The new course is aimed at beginners with Presto, who want to accelerate their
initial understanding and adoption. You ramp up quickly to install and configure
Presto, use the CLI, and learn how to query connected data sources with SQL. The
class is completely interactive, and I look forward to many of you joining me
and bring lots of great questions to ask. 

The class includes three interactive training exercises on
[Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/). They allow you to get hands on experience
with Presto immediately. Lots of useful tips and tricks are covered in my
material, and of course I plan to run a bunch of additional demos. You can find
more details about the content of the class in [the registration
page](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/presto-first-steps/0636920462859/).
