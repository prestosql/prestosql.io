Last year, [Presto Conference Tokyo 2019]({% post_url 2019-07-11-report-for-presto-conference-tokyo %}) 
was held in Japan with Martin Traverso, Dain Sundstrom and David Phillips, 
the founders of the Presto Software Foundation. 

This year, the event changes to be an online only event. Presto Conference 
Tokyo 2020 is happening on the 20th of November. 
You can [find out details and register right now](https://techplay.jp/event/795265)!

The event includes six sessions from Treasure Data, Amazon Web Services 
Japan, Repro and LINE, as well as open sessions with Martin and Brian Olsen, 
a Developer Advocate at Starburst Data.
This is a valuable opportunity to hear from engineers who are actually using 
Presto. It has something for those who are using Presto for data engineering
and those who don't use Presto yet but are interested in it.
