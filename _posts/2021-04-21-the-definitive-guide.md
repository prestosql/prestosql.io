Just over a year ago we [announced the availability of the first book about
Trino]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2020-04-11-the-definitive-guide %}) - our
definitive guide. Back then the project was still called Presto, and the rename
with the end of 2020 was a good reason for us to give the book a refresh.

Today, we are happy to announce that a new edition now titled __Trino: The
Definitive Guide__ is available.

The new edition of the book from O'Reilly is available in digital formats
as well as physical copies. You can find more information about the book on [our
permanent page about it](/trino-the-definitive-guide.html).

The book is now updated to Trino release 354 for all filenames, installation
methods, command, names and properties. We addressed all problems found by our
readers and reported to us as well.

Our major supporter, [Starburst](https://www.starburst.io), allowed us to work
on the book and bring it across the finish line again. You can get a
