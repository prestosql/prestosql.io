Joins are one of the most important parts of each database and SQL itself. 
Probably, most of the things below you are already well known. This post is going to help you structurize this knowledge.

* cross join - the simplest one, two tables are joined together without any condition. 
Every single row from the one table will be joined with every row from the other table - a cartesian pruduct [^join_syntax]:

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t("left"), (VALUES 3, 4) u("right");
 left | right 
------+-------
    1 |     3 
    2 |     3 
    1 |     4 
    2 |     4 
(4 rows)
~~~

* inner join - two tables are joined together under a condition. 
Every row from the one table will be joined with every row from the other table only when the join condition is satisfied. 

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t("left"), (VALUES 1, 1, 2) u("right") 
             WHERE t."left" = u."right";
 left | right 
------+-------
    1 |     1 
    1 |     1 
    2 |     2 
(3 rows)
~~~

* left outer join - like inner join, but when a pair of rows does not satisfy the join condition, the left row completed with `NULL` values is returned:

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t("left") 
             LEFT OUTER JOIN (VALUES 1, 1) u("right") 
             ON t."left" = u."right";
 left | right
------+-------
    1 |     1
    1 |     1
    2 | NULL
(3 rows)
~~~

* right outer join - like left outer join, but now the right row completed with `NULL` values is returned:

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t("left") 
             RIGHT OUTER JOIN (VALUES 1, 2, 3) u("right") 
             ON t."left" = u."right";
 left | right 
------+-------
    1 |     1 
    2 |     2 
 NULL |     3 
(3 rows)
~~~

* full outer join - when the join condition is not met, the left row completed with `NULL` values and the right row completed with `NULL` values are returned:

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t("left") 
             FULL OUTER JOIN (VALUES 1, 3) u("right") 
             ON t."left" = u."right";
 left | right
------+-------
    1 |     1
    2 | NULL
 NULL |     3
(3 rows)
~~~

There are also two implicit join types. Joins which do not have such a good syntax representation in SQL:

 * semi join - a row from the one table is returned when there exists a row in the other table for which a join condition is met. 
You might think that it is not a real join, as only values the one table are returned and values from the other table are not used in results. 
And maybe that it is one of reasons there is no `SEMI JOIN` syntax in SQL. 
In my opinion, it is commonly called as join because it requires values from both tables to evaluate the join condition. 
There are several ways to express such join in SQL, however each of them is not direct and may depend on the data you have, 
so its usage could be non trivial.
The easiest way is to use `IN` predicate [^simplicity]:

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t(one) WHERE t.one IN (VALUES 1, 1, 3);
 one 
-----
   1 
(1 row)
~~~

 * anti join - a very similar to semi join. 
A row from the one table is returned when there are no rows in the other table for which a condition could be satisfied. 
Here, as with semi join, there are also several ways to express such join. 
The easiest is to use `NOT IN`:

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2) t(one) WHERE t.one NOT IN (VALUES 1, 1, 3);
 one 
-----
   2 
~~~

The fact that the semi and anti joins do not have a proper syntax in SQL is somehow bitter. 
This causes that only a conjunction of equality comparisons can be used as join condition, while in other cases the user does not have such limitation. 
You cannot express anything like: `SELECT * FROM t SEMI JOIN u ON t.x > u.y`, instead you need to use a correlated subquery. 

~~~ sql
presto:tiny> SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 2, 4) t(one) WHERE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1, 1, 3) t(other) WHERE one > other);
 one 
-----
   2 
   4 
(2 rows)

Interesting point is that it is possible to compose one join by using other joins or another relational algebra operations.
For example, logically inner join could be build as the cross join with a filtering operation on top of it. 
In that case when you use `TRUE` as join condition then the inner join becomes a simple cross join, filter operation becomes irrelevant. 
Another option is that it is possible to create left outer join from inner join and anti join on top of it.

[^join_syntax]:
    Notice that SQL syntax gives two possible ways to use the cross and the inner joins. 
    One is to simply put tables separated with comas, and the other is when tables are separated with `JOIN` keyword.
    In case of the inner join, join condition can be placed after `ON` (when `JOIN` separator is used) keyword or within a `WHERE` clause.
    In regards of any `OUTER JOIN` the `ON` clause has to be used. This is due the fact that join condition has to be explicitly pointed.

[^simplicity]:
    The easiest in this context means, that it is the easiest for the user, though it may not be the most efficient way for database to execute that.
