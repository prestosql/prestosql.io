This version adds support for
[`FETCH FIRST ... WITH TIES`](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/sql/select.html#limit-or-fetch-first-clauses)
syntax, locality-awareness to default scheduler for better workload balancing, the new
[`format()`](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/functions/conversion.html#format) function,
and improved support for ORC bloom filters. Additionally, connectors can now provide
view definitions, which opens up several new use cases.
