**Wow!** If you would have to sum up what happened in the last year in this
great community, **wow** would be it. It is truly awe-inspiring to be part of
this incredible journey of Trino. Oh yeah, on that note. Our community and
project [chose the new name Trino]({% post_url 2020-12-27-announcing-trino %}),
to be able to continue to innovate and develop freely as a community of peers.
Presto® and Presto® SQL are a thing of the past.

Now that is out of the way, let’s dive right in and see what all our community
members across the globe have created with us!

<!--more-->

[2019 was a big year for us]({% post_url 2020-01-01-2019-summary %}), but check
out how 2020 eclipsed even that!
## By the numbers

Even the size and growth of [our community on Slack](/slack.html) is impressive:

* Started in January 2020 with ~1600 members and 280 weekly active
* Over 3200 members by December 2020
* 560 members active weekly

The innovation and change of [the source code on GitHub]({{
site.github_repo_url}}) is a result of the hard work of the community:

* Over 4000 commits merged
* More than 2800 pull requests received
* [23 releases](/docs/current/release.html#releases-2020), nearly every two
  weeks basically!

As you can see, much of the excitement around the name change has quickly
increased the number of stars we have on GitHub. While some of this certainly
stems from an initial buzz around a shiny new name, we also believe that this
name change has brought clarity to the community. Trino is an improved version,
supported by the founders and creators of Presto®, along with the major
contributors.

And if you have not done so already, make sure to [star the
repository]({{site.github_repo_url}}) and [join us on slack](/slack.html).

## Features and code

While everything mentioned is already exciting, the true work is visible in the
new features and improvements in Trino. It is a long list, but read on. You
won’t want to miss anything.

### Improvements to ANSI SQL support

A core feature of Trino is the ability to use the same standard SQL for any
connected data source. These improvements empower all users.

* Variable-precision temporal types, with precision down to picoseconds
  (10<sup>−12</sup>s). This a very important feature for any time critical
  systems such as financial transactions processing
* Correct, and now SQL specification compliant timestamp semantics, making
  migration of SQL statements from other compliant systems such as many RDBMSs
  easier
* Implicit coercions for `INSERT` clause
* Support for `RANGE` and `GROUPS`-based window frames
* More support for various shapes of correlated subqueries
* Support for `INTERSECT ALL` and `EXCEPT ALL`
* Parameter support in `LIMIT`, `FETCH FIRST`, and `OFFSET` clause
* Experimental support for [recursive queries](/docs/current/sql/select.html?highlight=recursive#with-recursive-clause)
* Enforcement of `NOT NULL` constraints when inserting data
* Quantified comparisons (e.g., `> ALL (...)`) in aggregation queries

### Other query improvements

A number of other features were added to make querying your data sources with
Trino even more powerful:

* [T-digest data type](/docs/current/language/types.html#t-digest) and functions
  for approximate quantile computations
* Support for setting and reading column comments
* Numerous new functions including `concat_ws()`, `regexp_count()`,
  `regexp_position()`, `contains_sequence()`, `murmur3()`,
  `from_unixtime_nanos()`, `from_iso8601_timestamp_nanos()`,
  `human_readable_seconds()`, `bitwise` operations, `luhn_check()`,
  `approx_most_frequent()`, `translate()`, `starts_with()`

## Performance

Trino is already [ludicrously fast](/index.html). But then again, even faster is
better, so we worked on that:

* Improved pushdown of complex operations into connectors, including
  [aggregation pushdown](/docs/current/optimizer/pushdown.html) and TopN
  pushdown.
* [Dynamic filtering and partition pruning]({% post_url
  2020-06-14-dynamic-partition-pruning %}), which can improve performance of
  highly selective joins manyfold.
* Cost-based decisions for queries containing `IN <subquery>` in `WHERE` clause.
* Information_schema performance improvements, which benefit third-party BI
  tools that need to inspect table metadata, for example DBeaver, Datagrip,
  Power BI, Tableau, Looker, and others.
* [Faster queries on nested data in Parquet and ORC]({% post_url
  2020-08-14-dereference-pushdown %}).
* Faster and more accurate `approx_percentile`, based on t-digest data structure.
* Support of Bloom filters in ORC.
* Experimental, optimized Parquet writer.

## Security

The more data you access with Trino, the more it becomes critical to secure it.
With that in mind we added a lot of improvements:

* The [Web UI](/docs/current/admin/web-interface.html) now requires
  authentication. Various actions such as viewing query details, killing
  queries, etc., are protected with authorization checks based on the identity
  of the user. Additionally, the UI now supports OAuth2 for user identification.
* External and internal APIs are now properly secured with authentication and
  authorization checks. Importantly, this fixes a [CVE reported
  vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15087)
  that affects all older versions of Presto®.
* A [new mechanism to externalize secrets in configuration
   files](/docs/current/security/secrets.html) that makes it easier to integrate
   with third-party secret managers and deployment tools.
* Support for JSON Web Key (JWK) authentication and [pluggable certificate
  authenticators](/docs/current/develop/certificate-authenticator.html).
* Add new [Salesforce authenticator](docs/current/security/salesforce.html).
* The query engine and access control SPIs now support injecting row filters and
  column masks.
* New syntax for managing permissions (`GRANT/REVOKE` on schema,
  `ALTER TABLE/SCHEMA/VIEW ... SET AUTHORIZATION`).

## Data sources

Trino empowers you to use one platform to access all data sources. Connectors
enable this and we added numerous new connectors:

* [Iceberg](/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html)
* [Prometheus](/docs/current/connector/prometheus.html)
* [Oracle](/docs/current/connector/oracle.html)
* [Pinot](/docs/current/connector/pinot.html)
* [Druid](/docs/current/connector/druid.html)
* [BigQuery](/docs/current/connector/bigquery.html)
* [MemSQL](/docs/current/connector/memsql.html)

All other connectors received a large host of improvements. Let’s just look at
two popular connectors:

### Hive connector for HDFS, S3, Azure and cloud object storage systems

* Complex Hive views, allows integration with Hive or simplifying
  migration from Hive
* [ACID transactional tables]({% post_url 2020-06-01-hive-acid %}) with `INSERT`
  and `DELETE` support
* [Built-in storage caching](/docs/current/connector/hive-caching.html) and
  support for [external caching with
  Alluxio](/docs/current/connector/hive-alluxio.html)
* New procedures: `system.drop_stats()`, `register_partition()`,
  `unregister_partition()`
* Support for [Azure object storage](/docs/current/connector/hive-azure.html)
* Support for [S3 encrypted files, flexible S3 security mappings and
  Intelligent-Tiering S3 storage](/docs/current/connector/hive-s3.html)

### Elasticsearch connector

The [Elasticsearch connector](/docs/current/connector/elasticsearch.html)
received numerous powerful improvements:

* Password authentication
* Support for index aliases
* Support for array types, Nested, and IP type
* Support for Elasticsearch 7.x

## Runtime improvements

Operating and maintaining a Trino cluster takes a significant amount of
resources. So any work to improve the runtime needs have a significant positive
impact:

* [Requirement to use Java
  11](/docs/current/installation/deployment.html#java-runtime-environment), with
  better GC performance, overall performance, and improved also container
  support
* Support for ARM64-based processors to run Trino
* Support for minimum number of workers before query starts, useful for
  implementing autoscaling
* [Data integrity checks for network transfers]({% post_url
  2020-06-25-data-integrity-protection %}) to prevent data corruption during
  processing

## Everything else

There is so much more to capture, and you really would have to read all the
[release notes](/docs/current/release.html#releases-2020) in detail to know it
all. To safe you from that, here are a few more noteworthy changes:

* JDBC driver backward compatibility tests
* Support for multiple event listeners
* Added Python client support for exec with parameters
* New look and navigation for the [documentation](/docs/current/index.html), and
  lots of new content

## Community resources and events

Beyond the raw code and helping each other, the community collaborated on other
helpful resources like books and in-depth video tutorials.

[Matt](https://github.com/mattsfuller), [Manfred](https://github.com/mosabua),
and [Martin](https://github.com/martint)  published the book [Presto: The
Definitive Guide](/presto-the-definitive-guide.html) with O'Reilly. Over 5000
readers took advantage of the [free digital copy]({% post_url
2020-04-11-the-definitive-guide
%}).

Brian and Manfred launched the live streaming event [Trino Community
Broadcast](broadcast/index.html), and grew their audience and back catalog to
include some very useful material. If you have not seen it yet, go and [watch
some old episodes](/broadcast/episodes.html) and join us in the next ones.

We also had a number of other online events and presentations, with direct
participation of our community members:

* A [dedicated conference event](% post_url 2020-11-21-a-report-about-presto-conference-tokyo-2020 %})
  for the community in Japan was very successful.
* The [Argentina Big Data Meetup](% post_url
  2020-09-28-argentina-big-data-meetup %}) had a large audience from the
  community in South America

A series of virtual events around the project started with a roadmap and
overview meeting and included a number real world use case examples at scale:

* [State of Trino]({% post_url 2020-05-15-state-of-presto %})
* [Trino at Pinterest]({% post_url 2020-07-22-presto-summit-pinterest %})
* [Trino Migration at ARM Treasure Data]({% post_url 2020-07-06-presto-summit-arm-td %})
* [Trino at Zuora]({% post_url 2020-06-16-presto-summit-zuora %})

Another series of training classes with the project founders was hugely
successful. It includes very valuable content for any Trino user, from beginners
to experts, that you should not miss:

* [Advanced SQL in Trino with David]({% post_url 2020-07-15-training-advanced-sql %})
* [Understanding and Tuning Trino Query Processing with Martin]({% post_url 2020-07-30-training-query-tuning %})
* [Securing Trino with Dain]({% post_url 2020-08-13-training-security %})
* [Configuring and Tuning Trino with Dain]({% post_url 2020-08-27-training-performance %})

## Conclusion

2020 was a wild ride for us all. Trino and the Trino community definitely
emerged as a winner, and we are looking forward to a very bright future with you
all.

A couple of ongoing work is already underway and very promising:

* Optimized Parquet reader, on par with ORC reader support
* Support for SQL `UPDATE` and `MERGE` statements
* Oauth2 support for JDBC
* Support for SQL `WINDOW` clause and `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` usage

We’re starting the new year with a shiny new name, a cute little bunny, and a
very vibrant community. The future is looking great for Trino!
