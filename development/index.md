## Code Style

The Presto code base has a consistent style throughout.  The style is documented for Java code in the
[Airlift code style project](https://github.com/airlift/codestyle), which includes a configuration for IntelliJ.

For all other languages, it is expected that new code matches the style used for
existing code in that language.
