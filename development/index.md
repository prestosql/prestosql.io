    <h2>Path to committership</h2>

    <p>
        Committers perform final reviews and merge the changes into the codebase.  Committers are the most active
        members of the community, and spend a significant amount of time reviewing community contributions.

    <h2>Code Style</h2>

    <p>
        The Presto code base has a consistent style throughout.  The style is documented for Java code in the
        <a href="https://github.com/airlift/codestyle">Airlift code style project</a>, which includes a configuration for IntelliJ.
        For all other languages, it is expected that new code will style-match existing code in that language.
