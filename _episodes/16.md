## Concept of the week: Apache Druid and realtime analytics

This week covers Apache Druid, a modern, real-time OLAP database. Joining us is 
the head of developer relations at Imply, the company that creates an enterprise
 version of Druid, to cover what Druid is, and the use cases it solves.

Here are the slides that Rachel uses in the show:

### Druid Architecture

Druid has several process types:

 - **Coordinator** processes manage data availability on the cluster.
 - **Overlord** processes control the assignment of data ingestion workloads.
 - **Broker** processes handle queries from external clients.
 - **Router** processes are optional processes that can route requests to Brokers, Coordinators, and Overlords.
 - **Historical** processes store queryable data.
 - **MiddleManager** processes are responsible for ingesting data.

The Druid architecture.
</p>

Druid processes can be deployed any way you like, but for ease of deployment we 
suggest organizing them into three server types: Master, Query, and Data.

 - Master: Runs Coordinator and Overlord processes, manages data availability and ingestion.
 - Query: Runs Broker and optional Router processes, handles queries from external clients.
 - Data: Runs Historical and MiddleManager processes, executes ingestion workloads and stores all queryable data.

## PR of the week: PR 3522 Add Druid connector

Our guest, Samarth, is the author of this weeks 
[PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/3522). 
[Puneet Jaiswal](https://twitter.com/puneetjaiswal) is the first engineer that
started work to add a Druid connector. Later, Samarth picked up the torch and 
the Trino Druid connector became available in 
[release 337](/docs/current/release/release-337.html). 

An honorable mention goes to our other guest, Parth, for doing some 
[preliminary work](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/3697) that enabled 
aggregation pushdown in the SPI. This enabled the use of the Druid connector to
actually scale well with the completion of PR 4313 (see future work below).

A [third honorable PR](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/3881), 
that was completed by [@findepi](https://twitter.com/findepi), was adding 
pushdown to the jdbc client which appeared in release 337 along with the Druid 
connector.

It is incredible to see the amount of hands that various features and connectors
pass through to get to the final release.

### Future work:

 - [SPI and optimizer rule for connectors that can support complete topN (PR 4249)](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/4249)
 - [Implement aggregate pushdown for Druid (PR 4313)](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/4313)
 - [Optimizer rule to support aggregate pushdown with grouping sets (PR 4554)](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/4554)

## Demo: Using the Druid Web UI to create an ingestion spec querying via Trino

Let's start up the Druid cluster along with the required Zookeeper and 
PostgreSQL instance. Clone this repository and navigate to the `trino-druid`
directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started.git

cd druid/trino-druid

docker-compose up -d
```

To do batch insert, navigate to the Druid Web UI once it has finished starting 
up at <http://localhost:8888>. Once that is done, click the "Load data" button, 
choose, "Example data", and follow the prompts to create the native batch 
ingestion spec. Once the spec is created, run the job and ingest the data.
More information can be found here: <https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/index.html>

</p>

Once Druid completes the task, open up a Trino connection and validate that the 
`druid` catalog exists.

```
docker exec -it trino-druid_trino-coordinator_1 trino

trino> SHOW CATALOGS;

 Catalog 
---------
 druid   
 system  
 tpcds   
 tpch    
(4 rows)

```

Now show the tables under the `druid.druid` schema.

```
trino> SHOW TABLES IN druid.druid;
   Table   
-----------
 wikipedia 
(1 row)

```

Run a `SHOW CREATE TABLE`  to see the column definitions.

```
trino> SHOW CREATE TABLE druid.druid.wikipedia;
             Create Table             
--------------------------------------
 CREATE TABLE druid.druid.wikipedia ( 
    __time timestamp(3) NOT NULL,     
    added bigint NOT NULL,            
    channel varchar,                  
    cityname varchar,                 
    comment varchar,                  
    commentlength bigint NOT NULL,    
    countryisocode varchar,           
    countryname varchar,              
    deleted bigint NOT NULL,          
    delta bigint NOT NULL,            
    deltabucket bigint NOT NULL,      
    diffurl varchar,                  
    flags varchar,                    
    isanonymous varchar,              
    isminor varchar,                  
    isnew varchar,                    
    isrobot varchar,                  
    isunpatrolled varchar,            
    metrocode varchar,                
    namespace varchar,                
    page varchar,                     
    regionisocode varchar,            
    regionname varchar,               
    user varchar                      
 )                                    
(1 row)
```

Finally, query the first 5 rows of data showing the user and how much they added.

```
trino> SELECT user, added FROM druid.druid.wikipedia LIMIT 5;
      user       | added 
-----------------+-------
 Lsjbot          |    31

```

## Question of the week: Why doesn't the Druid connector use the native json over http calls?

To answer this question I'm going to quote Samarth and Parth on this from 
[this super long but enlightening thread](https://trinodb.slack.com/archives/CHD6386E4/p1589311502029000?thread_ts=1586167749.002500&cid=CHD6386E4)
on the subject.

### Samarth's take:

Pro JDBC:
 1. Going forward, Druid SQL is going to be the de-facto way of accessing Druid 
 data with native JSON queries being more of an advanced level use case. A 
 benefit of down the SQL route is that we can take advantage of all the changes 
 made in the Druid SQL optimizer land like using vectorized query processing 
 when possible, when to use a TopN vs group by query type, etc.  If we were to 
 hit historicals directly, which don't support SQL querying, we potentially 
 won't be taking advantages of such optimizations unless we keep
 porting/applying them to the trino-druid connector which may not always be 
 possible.
 
 2. If we end up letting a Trino node act as a Druid broker (which is what 
 would happen I assume when you let a Trino node do the final merging), then, 
 you would need to allocate  similar kinds of resources (direct memory buffers, 
 etc.) to all the Trino worker nodes as a Druid broker which may not be ideal.
 
 3. This is not necessarily a limitation but adds complexity - with your proposed 
 implementation, the Trino cluster will need to maintain state about what Druid
 segments are hosted on what data nodes (middle managers and historicals). The 
 Druid broker already maintains that state and having to replicate and store all
 that state on the Trino coordinator will demand more resources out of it.
 
 4. To your point on SCAN query overwhelming the broker - that shouldn't be the 
 case as Druid scan query type streams results through broker instead of 
 materializing all of them in memory. See: <https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/scan-query.html>

Pro HTTP:
 1. One use case where directly hitting the historicals may help is when the 
 group by key space is large (like a group by on UUID like column). For a very 
 large data set, a Druid broker can get overwhelmed when performing the giant 
 merge. By hitting historicals directly, we can let historicals do first level 
 merge followed by multiple Trino workers doing the second level merge. I am 
 not sure if solving for this limited use case is worth going the http native
 query route, though. IMHO, Druid generally isn't built for pulling lots of 
 data out of it. You can do it, but whether you want to push that work down to 
 Druid cluster or let Trino directly pull it down for you is debatable. 
 
I would advocate for going the Druid SQL route at least for the initial version 
of the connector. This would provide a solution for the majority of the use 
cases that Druid generally is used for (OLAP style queries over pre-aggregated 
data). We could in the next version of the connector, possibly focus on adding a
new mode of the connector which can make native JSON queries directly to the 
Druid historicals and middle managers instead of submitting SQL queries to the 
broker.

### Parth's take:

Our general take is that Druid is designed as OLAP cube and so it is really fast
when it comes to aggregate queries over reasonable cardinality dimensions and 
will not work well for use cases that are treating it like a regular data 
warehouse and trying to do pure select scans with filter. The primary reason 
most of our users would look to Trino's Druid connector is:

 1. To be able to join already aggregated data in Druid to some other datastore 
 in our warehouse.
 
 2. To gain access through tooling that doesn't have good support for Druid 
 inherently for dashboarding use cases (think Tableau).
 
Even if we wanted to support the use cases that Druid is not designed for in a 
more efficient manner by going thorough historicals directly, it has other 
implications. We are now talking about partial aggregation pushdown which is 
more complicated IMO than our current approach of complete pushdown. We could 
choose to take the approach that others have taken where we can incrementally 
add a mode to Druid connector to either use JDBC or go directly to historical, 
but I really don't think it's a good idea to block the current development in 
hopes of a more efficient future version specially when this is just 
implementation detail that we can switch anytime without breaking any user 
queries.
