## Concept of the week: Trino for the Trinewbie

One of the best and easiest ways to get an understanding about Trino, and how to
use it is the book Trino: Definitive Guide. The next three sections have a few 
excerpts from the book that does an incredible job at introducing the space 
Trino is in. If you would like to read the book in its entirety, Starburst 
offers [the digital copy for free](https://www.starburst.io/info/oreilly-trino-guide/).

### The Problems with Big Data

Everybody is capturing more and more data from device metrics, user behavior
tracking, business transactions, location data, software and system testing 
procedures and workflows, and much more. The insights gained from understanding
that data and working with it can make or break the success of any initiative,
or even a company.

At the same time, the diversity of storage mechanisms available for data has 
exploded: relational databases, NoSQL databases, document databases, key-value 
stores, object storage systems, and so on. Many of them are necessary in today’s
organizations, and it is no longer possible to use just one of them.

### What is Trino?

Trino is not a database with storage, rather, it simply queries data where it 
lives. When using Trino, storage and compute are decoupled and can be scaled 
independently. Trino represents the compute layer, whereas the underlying data 
sources represent the storage layer.

This allows Trino to scale up and down its compute resources for query 
processing, based on analytics demand to access this data. There is no need to 
move your data, and provision compute and storage to the exact needs of the 
current queries, or change that regularly, based on your changing query needs.

Trino can scale the query power by scaling the compute cluster dynamically, and 
the data can be queried right where it lives in the data source. This 
characteristic allows you to greatly optimize your hardware resource needs and 
therefore reduce cost.

### SQL-on-Anything

Trino was initially designed to query data from HDFS. And it can do that very 
efficiently, as you learn later. But that is not where it ends. On the contrary,
Trino is a query engine that can query data from object storage, relational
database management systems (RDBMSs), NoSQL databases, and other systems.

Trino queries data where it lives and does not require a migration of data to a 
single location. So Trino allows you to query data in HDFS and other distributed
object storage systems. It allows you to query RDBMSs and other data sources. As
such, it can really query data wherever it lives and therefore be a replacement
to the traditional, expensive, and heavy extract, transform, and load (ETL) 
processes. Or at a minimum, it can help you with them and lighten the load. So 
Trino is clearly not just another SQL-on-Hadoop solution.

Object storage systems include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service
(S3), Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and S3-compatible 
storage such as MinIO and Ceph. Trino can query traditional RDBMSs such as 
Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Teradata, and Amazon Redshift. 
Trino can also query NoSQL systems such as Apache Cassandra, Apache Kafka, 
MongoDB, or Elasticsearch. Trino can query virtually anything and is truly a 
SQL-on-Anything system.

For users, this means that suddenly they no longer have to rely on specific 
query languages or tools to interact with the data in those specific systems.
They can simply leverage Trino and their existing SQL skills and their 
well-understood analytics, dashboarding, and reporting tools. These tools, 
built on top of using SQL, allow analysis of those additional data sets, which 
are otherwise locked in separate systems. Users can even use Trino to query 
across different systems with the SQL they know.

### Contributing to Trino

In this episode, Marius Grama discusses his journey with Trino. From joining the
community, his first impressions and experiences, and what led him to make 
sixteen commits over the last three months. We also ask him where he thinks we 
could improve to make the onboarding experience better.

In the Trino project there are four [roles](/development/roles.html).
You can immediately become a participant or reviewer. To be a contributor, you
need to follow some steps that are covered later in the episode. Likewise, for
maintainers, there is a path to becoming a maintainer that is discussed in 
detail on the roles page.

#### Participants

> Participants are those who show up and join in discussions about the project. 
> Users, developers, and administrators can all be participants, as can 
> literally anyone who has the time, energy, and passion to become involved. 
> Participants suggest improvements and new features. They report bugs, 
> regressions, performance issues, and so on. They work to make Trino better for
> everyone.

#### Contributors

Today's episode covers the process that a contributor goes through to make a
code change, but simply put:

> A contributor submits code changes to Trino. 

#### Reviewers

> A reviewer reads a proposed change to Trino, and assesses how well the change 
> aligns with the Trino vision and guidelines. This includes everything from 
> high level project vision to low level code style. Everyone is invited and 
> encouraged to review others’ contributions – you don’t need to be a maintainer
> for that.

#### Maintainers

> A maintainer is responsible for checking in code only after ensuring it has 
> been reviewed thoroughly and aligns with the Trino vision and guidelines. In 
> addition to merging code, a maintainer actively participates in discussions 
> and reviews. Being a maintainer does not grant additional rights in the 
> project to make changes, set direction, or anything else that does not align 
> with the direction of the project. Instead, a maintainer is expected to bring
> these to the project participants as needed to gain consensus. The maintainer
> role is for an individual, so if a maintainer changes employers, the role is 
> retained. However, if a maintainer is no longer actively involved in the 
> project, their maintainer status will be reviewed.

There is [a writeup on the Apache Hive process to become a committer.](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/BecomingACommitter)
For context, a committer is equivalent to a maintainer in Trino. This writeup
aligns precisely with the Trino philosophy. Here are a few good quotes from that
article:

> Contributors often ask Hive PMC members the question, "What do I need to do in
> order to become a committer?" The simple (though frustrating) answer to this 
> question is, "If you want to become a committer, behave like a committer." If 
> you follow this advice, then rest assured that the PMC will notice, and 
> committership will seek you out rather than the other way around.

> It should go without saying, but here it is anyway: your participation in the 
> project should be a natural part of your work with Hive; if you find yourself 
> undertaking tasks "so that you can become a committer", then you're doing it 
> wrong, young padawan. This is particularly true if your motivations for 
> wanting to become a committer are primarily negative or self-centered

## PR of the week: PR 8135 Set default time zone for the current session

The [PR of the week](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/8135), was committed 
by today's guest, [Marius Grama](https://twitter.com/findinpath).

This fixes [issue 8112](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/8112) by adding
support for the `SET TIME ZONE` statement. The time zone specified is being 
stored as a session property and has a lower precedence than 
`sql.forced-session-time-zone` setting.

Thanks Marius!

## Demo: Contributing to Trino

Here is the video that goes into detail on the steps below on how to contribute
code to Trino!

1. Download an IDE.

    First, you need to have an integrated development environment (IDE) to run 
    the code. We recommend [Intellij Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
    as it is the standard that is used by developers across the project. Of 
    course, you may use any IDE you like, but there may be issues that others 
    may not be able to help with as readily.

1. Install Git.

    [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version source control software 
    used to collaborate code with other users. You must 
    [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    in order to contribute to the project.
    
1. Install Docker.

    The Trino testing framework runs Trino and other databases it connects to on
    Docker, a tool that runs different services in isolation using containers.  
    Go ahead and [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on 
    your system.

1. Create and configure your GitHub account.

    GitHub is a free hosted Git repository, and a central point of collaboration
    for the Trino project. If you haven't done so, please 
    [create and configure your GitHub account](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration).

1. Make a fork of the Trino repository on GitHub

    Navigate to [the Trino repository](https://github.com/trinodb/trino) and 
    click the "fork" button. Or you can just click it here: <a 
    class="github-button" href="https://github.com/trino/trinodb/fork" 
    data-icon="octicon-repo-forked" data-size="large">Fork</a>. 

    You want to create a fork so that you can save your work without needing the
    special privileges it takes to commit code back to the Trino repository. 
    This way, you can upload (also called a "push" in Git) your code to your 
    fork and later open a pull request into the main Trino repository.

1. Clone your fork of the Trino repository to your computer and import into Intellij.

    Execute the following clone command in your terminal:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/trino.git
    ```
   
    Open the [Trino project in Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html#maven_import_project_start).

1. Add the Airlift code style checks to Intellij.

   There are many unspoken rules to code style and formatting in any project. 
   Trino is no exception. To make life simpler on the contributor and reviewer, 
   the [Trino code style definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airlift/codestyle/master/IntelliJIdea2019/Airlift.xml) 
   that [you can import into Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/copying-code-style-settings.html) 
   to have the `Reformat Code` action to format in the desired style of the project.
    
1. Build the project.

   One of the greatest resources in trino history is [this cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/findepi/04c96f0f60dcc95329f569bb0c44a0cd)
   created by [Piotr Findeisen](https://twitter.com/findepi). I use it for some
   of the commands, but the most important use, is the "fast" build command he
   adds on the top. In your terminal, make sure you are located in the root 
   directory of the Trino project, and run the following command.
   
   ```
   ./mvnw -pl '!:trino-server-rpm,!:trino-docs,!:trino-proxy,!:trino-verifier,!:trino-benchto-benchmarks' clean install \
   -TC2 -nsu \
   -DskipTests \
   -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true \
   -Dmaven.source.skip=true \
   -Dair.check.skip-all=true
   ```
   
   This builds all necessary modules of the project to run almost everything
   in Trino. The build excludes some modules, runs the compiler on multiple 
   threads, skips the tests, javadocs, and the Airlift code style checks. If you
   would like to run code style check on a specific module (e.g. 
   trino-elasticsearch) then you can run the following command.
   
   ```
   ./mvnw -pl ':trino-elasticsearch' clean install \
   -TC2 -nsu \
   -DskipTests \
   -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true \
   -Dmaven.source.skip=true 
   ```

1. Sign the CLA.
    
    Sign the [contributor license agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/trinodb/cla/blob/master/Trino%20Foundation%20Individual%20CLA.pdf) 
    to agree that all of your code you commit to the project is subject to the 
    Apache License 2.0. Once you sign the agreement, scan and submit the form to
    [cla@trino.io](mailto:cla@trino.io). This email gets checked every few days,
    and you can check if your name has been added to the [contributors](https://github.com/trinodb/cla/blob/master/contributors)
    list.
    
1. At this point you can look for an [issue labeled "good first issue"](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
This identifies issues that we think are more approachable for developers that 
aren't as familiar with the Trino repository yet.

1. One final thing before you move on to the contribution process. Before you
start jumping in and changing the code, you'll also want to create a special
branch for your changes. A branch in git makes a separate workflow for all the 
changes you make to be isolated, If something goes wrong, or you need to 
compare with an older branch you can do so. The default branch may either be
named `master` or `main`. See [more on branching in git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

To make a branch for your feature, you can run the following command:

```
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

1. Follow the remaining steps in the [contribution process page](https://trino.io/development/process.html).

## Question of the week: How do I remove nulls from an array in Trino?

A [question posted to StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66162776) 
asked the following question:

> I'm extracting data from a json column in Trino and getting the output in an 
array like this `['AL', NULL, 'NEW']`. The problem is I need to remove the null since
the array has to be mapped another array.I tried several options but no luck.
How can I remove the null and get only `['AL', 'NEW']` without unnesting?

[Piotr Findeisen](https://twitter.com/findepi) replied: 

You can use [filter()](https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/array.html#filter)
for this:

```
trino> SELECT filter(ARRAY['AL', NULL,'NEW'], e -> e IS NOT NULL);
   _col0
-----------
 [AL, NEW]
(1 row)
```
