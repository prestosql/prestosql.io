## Concept of the week: Cost Based Optimizer
We're continuing our series covering some fundamental topics that build up to
dynamic filtering! This week we're discussing the cost-based optimizer with
Presto co-creator [Martin Traverso](https://twitter.com/mtraverso)!

### Parser/Analyzer

To recap, in [episode 6](6.html) we discussed a little bit about the various
forms a query takes from submission to the coordinator, to actually being
executed. We discussed how the parser generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) 
and the analyzer checks for valid SQL including functions and making sure tables
and columns being referenced actually exist. 

![](/assets/episode/7/ast.png)

Here's an example of an abstract syntax tree from last weeks episode for query
`SELECT * FROM (VALUES 1) t(a) WHERE a = 1 OR 1 = a OR a = 1;`.

### Planner

The next phase we discussed was the planner. Internally, the planner and
optimizer overlap substantially, but you can think of the planner as the early
part of the planning phase that generates the logical query, and over several
optimization iterations becomes an optimized distributed query. The planner
generates a new tree data structure called the plan IR (intermediate
representation) that contains nodes representing the steps that need to be
performed in order to answer the query. The leaves of the tree get executed 
first, and the parents of each node are dependent on the action of its child
completing before it can start.

![](/assets/episode/7/logical.png)

Here's ab example of a logical plan tree using the same query form the AST
above. Since this query isn't pulling from a data source, the distributed
plan is equivalent to the logical plan.

### Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)

In the cost-based optimizer phase, there are various rules that are applied
to the Plan IR that slowly optimize the structure into the final distributed
plan that is then executed. To do this, the optimizer retrieves some statistical
metadata of the tables and their data. This information includes, table row
counts, column data size, column low/high value, distinct column value count, 
and the percentage of null values in a column. With the list of rules that aim
to leverage these statistics, the optimizer improves the query structure that 
improves on parallelism based on the number of workers to the number of sources.

If you want to jump into the code, start at 
[the entry point](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/348/presto-main/src/main/java/io/prestosql/sql/planner/LogicalPlanner.java#L188)
for the planner/optimizer and the initial planning starts on 
[this line](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/348/presto-main/src/main/java/io/prestosql/sql/planner/LogicalPlanner.java#L200). 
This loop is where the [actual optimization](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/348/presto-main/src/main/java/io/prestosql/sql/planner/LogicalPlanner.java#L205)
occurs. So if you are interested, maybe grab a brandy ðŸ¥ƒ and take some time to
set your debugger at these points and watch the optimizer do its thing!

## PR of the week: PR 1415 Decorrelate subqueries with Limit or TopN

In this week's pull request <https://github.com/prestosql/presto/pull/1415>, 
done by Presto contributer and Starburst Engineer [kasiafi](https://github.com
/kasiafi). 

Before we can jump into this PR, let's discuss what a subquery is and further
what a correlated subquery is. In SQL you have a nested query that runs within
another query, typically embedded within a `WHERE` clause or `SELECT` statement.
Take this query for example:

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT a, b, c
FROM table
WHERE a > (SELECT t2.a FROM table2 t2 WHERE t2.d < 60);
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, we have a standard non-correlated subquery that runs on 
`table2`. The reason it is not correlated is because there are no dependencies
on the parent query that is being run on `table`. This type of query enables the
SQL engine to run the subquery first and then use those results to run the
parent query after. In the case of a correlated query, you typically have at
least one criterion in the nested query that depends on the parent. This
requires that the nested query gets executed for each row of the parent query. 
Take a look at this correlated query:

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT a, b, c
FROM table t1
WHERE a > (SELECT t2.a FROM table2 t2 WHERE t2.d < 60 AND t1.b <> t2.b);
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, we are running the subquery in the context of the row in order
to evaluate the value of `t1.b`. Having this query run for every row of the
parent query is certainly not ideal if it is not required and that is why
subquery decorrelation is a common optimization technique if an equivalent
non-correlated subquery exists for a given correlated subquery.

This pull request adds a rule that added the ability for Presto to handle the
decorrelation of a subquery containing a `LIMIT` or (`ORDER` + `LIMIT` i.e.
TopN) clauses. So, the common trick during decorrelation is to turn it into a 
query that can process the results from the inner table in one shot. The
approach is to flatten the results of executing the subquery for every row into
a single stream of rows before it is finally ready for execution.

This change also applies to a `LATERAL` join, which behaves a lot like a nested
subquery only that it acts as a table and returns multiple rows instead of
just a single row.

## PR Demo: PR 1415 Decorrelate subqueries with Limit or TopN

{% highlight SQL %}
SELECT (
   SELECT t.a 
   FROM (VALUES 1, 2, 3) t(a)
   WHERE t.a = t2.b
   LIMIT 2
) 
FROM (VALUES 1) t2(b);

SELECT (
   SELECT t.a 
   FROM (VALUES (1, 2), (1, 3)) t(a, b) 
   WHERE t.a = t2.a AND t2.b > 1 
   LIMIT 1
) FROM (VALUES (1, 2)) t2(a, b);

SELECT (
   SELECT t.b 
   FROM (VALUES (1, 2), (1, 3)) t(a, b) 
   WHERE t.a = t2.a AND t2.b > 1 
   ORDER BY t.b 
   LIMIT 1
) FROM (VALUES (1, 2)) t2(a, b)

### Fails
# 1) Returns more than one row from subquery.
# This query actually fails on execution on not during planning/optimizing where
# the other two below fail .
SELECT (
   SELECT t.a 
   FROM (VALUES 1, 1, 2, 3) t(a)
   WHERE t.a = t2.b
   LIMIT 2
) 
FROM (VALUES 1) t2(b);

# 2) Limit and correlated non-equality predicate in the subquery
SELECT (
   SELECT t.b 
   FROM (VALUES (1, 2), (1, 3)) t(a, b)
   WHERE t.a = t2.a AND t.b > t2.b 
   LIMIT 1
) FROM (VALUES (1, 2)) t2(a, b);

# 3) TopN and correlated non-equality predicate in the subquery
SELECT (
   SELECT t.b 
   FROM (VALUES (1, 2), (1, 3)) t(a, b) 
   WHERE t.a = t2.a AND t.b > t2.b 
   ORDER BY t.b 
   LIMIT 1
) FROM (VALUES (1, 2)) t2(a, b)
{% endhighlight %}

After the show Kasia pointed out that the failing queries were not all failing 
for the same reason. The first failing query above actually gets planned and
executed, but the exception occurs during the execution. The rest actually
fail during the planning and optimization phase as they were unable to be 
decorrelated due to the issue I line out in the comments above.
 
## Question of the week: 

In this week's question, we answer: Will running Presto on my relational 
database make processing faster?

> I have been going over the docs of PrestoSQL and it seems to fit some of my 
> requirements. I am little concerned about the resources needed to run Presto 
> in production. Because the size of my prod data is between 3-5GB and there
> will be very minimal data growth. Is Presto suitable for such a small 
> data size?

Many times, the idea that Presto is fast gets conflated with the idea that
Presto is a good fit for all use cases. It is important to understand that
Presto is a) not a database b) not developed for OLTP workloads and c) built
to handle data at the scale of Terabytes to Petabytes over distributed queries.
Since Presto uses a connector framework, it also has an added benefit of running
federated queries to whatever data source that returns data that can be
represented in some columnar fashion.

For relatively small size data sets you should try directly using your
relational database first. Doing this is better for small data sets. Database
indexes are really nice if youâ€™re not in big data world and if you give your
SQL Server say 10 GB memory, it should be running fully in-memory and thus
â€” fast.
