Presto nation, We want to hear from you! If you have a question or pull request 
that you would like us to feature on the show please join the 
[Presto slack](slack.html) and go to the 
\#presto-community-broadcast channel and let us know there. Otherwise, you can 
message Manfred Moser or Brian Olsen directly. Also, feel free to reach out
to us on our Twitter channels Brian 
[@bitsondatadev](https://twitter.com/bitsondatadev) and Manfred 
[@simpligility](https://twitter.com/simpligility).

This week we had a bit of a technical issue between zoom and OBS so there was 
some editing done to remove a portion of the broadcast which mainly cuts out us 
covering the releases. We circle back and give a small summary but unfortunately
 lost the majority of that part of the conversation.

In this week’s concept, we cover a general overview of kubernetes and how 
kubernetes is used when deploying and scaling up Presto. We also dive into how 
this is being used at our guest Cory Darby’s company, BlueCat.

In this week's pull request covers a pull request 
<https://github.com/prestosql/presto/pull/2462> which closes ticket 
<https://github.com/prestosql/presto/issues/2441>. This was actually a PR Brian
submitted some months ago. He dives into a bit about 
[Elasticsearch mappings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html) 
and how Elasticsearch models their data. He then covers how this motivated the 
pull request addressing the need for explicit mappings of which elasticsearch 
fields are array types vs scalar.

In this week's question, we answer, “Why does the web ui say “disabled”?” This 
typically comes from a security setup issue and there’s another similar issue
 when you are using a proxy that we cover as a bonus.
