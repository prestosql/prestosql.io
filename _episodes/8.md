## In this episode...

Well, we're back, and no longer waving the Presto¬Æ flag like we did before. If 
you haven't heard, Presto¬Æ SQL is now Trino (
[Read more about that here](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html)).
In this episode, we sit down with the four original creators of Presto¬Æ and
discuss the journey in more detail of what led us to our current trajectory with
the Presto¬Æ SQL project and why that is now being renamed to Trino. We also
discuss how this affects those that are using Trino. If you are developing on
Trino and have the old namespace check out the 
[guide to migrate here](https://trino.io/blog/2021/01/04/migrating-from-prestosql-to-trino.html).

We also discuss the differences between the two projects. It is actually a lot
after two years since the split, and we recommend looking at the
[blog we wrote at the end of 2019](https://trino.io/blog/2020/01/01/2019-summary.html)
and keep your eyes peeled for the blog we are writing to summarize the changes
in 2020!

Finally, we cover some sneak peeks at the roadmap for Trino in 2021.
