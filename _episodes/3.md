Presto nation, We want to hear from you! If you have a question or pull request 
that you would like us to feature on the show please join the 
[Trino community chat](slack.html) and go to the 
\#trino-community-broadcast channel and let us know there. Otherwise, you can 
message Manfred Moser or Brian Olsen directly. Also, feel free to reach out
to us on our Twitter channels Brian 
[@bitsondatadev](https://twitter.com/bitsondatadev) and Manfred 
[@simpligility](https://twitter.com/simpligility).

In this week’s concept, Manfred discusses what an SPI (service provider 
interface) is and covers the connector architecture of Presto, Starburst, and 
Custom.

In this week's pull request <{{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/4462>, 
came from user [Sven Pfennig](https://github.com/0xE282B0). Sven works for 
[Syncier GmbH](syncier.com) and as part of his role there he gets to contribute
to open source projects such as Presto. Thanks Sven! We jump into a quick setup
of a kafka broker using the 
[kafka quickstart tutorial](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) and I use the 
[kafkacat tool](https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat) to show off the addition 
of headers in Kafka that Sven has provided us and discuss why this is 
beneficial.

Here’s the crazy select statement I used to decode the binary values to utf text
of the foo column
```
SELECT 
   _message, 
   reduce(element_at(_headers,'foo'), '', (s, c) -> s || from_utf8(c), s -> s) AS foo 
FROM kafka.default.pcb 
WHERE contains(map_keys(_headers), 'foo');
```

An alternative tutorial that uses the TPC dataset can be located on the website site. 
<{{site.url}}/docs/current/connector/kafka-tutorial.html>

This weeks question was accidentally cut off as I had mapped my Shift + R key to
toggle streaming/recording and this cut the broadcast when I typed the R in
FROM.
