Presto nation, We want to hear from you! If you have a question or pull request 
that you would like us to feature on the show please join the 
[Trino community chat](slack.html) and go to the 
\#trino-community-broadcast channel and let us know there. Otherwise, you can 
message Manfred Moser or Brian Olsen directly. Also, feel free to reach out
to us on our Twitter channels Brian 
[@bitsondatadev](https://twitter.com/bitsondatadev) and Manfred 
[@simpligility](https://twitter.com/simpligility).

In this week’s concept, Manfred discusses ACID in general, CAP theorem, 
HDFS and Hive before ACID, and now ORC ACID and similar support.

ACID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID>
 - Atomicity - Transaction completely succeeds or completely fails, no partial 
results so no inconsistent relationships left tangling and such. The database
 remains in a consistent state.
 - Consistency - database content always adheres to defined rules (key
 constraints).
 - Isolation, transactions are isolated from each other and can run in parallel
  with same result as sequentially.
 - Durability - no data is lost after transaction completion.

ACID used to be a crucial criteria for a “serious” relational database system.

Then came big data and the CAP theorem. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem>

- Consistency
- Availability
- Partition tolerance

In this week's pull request <{{site.github_repo_url}}/pull/5402>,
came from contributor [David Stryker](https://github.com/djsstarburst). David
covers some interesting aspects to working on this pull request. This commit
adds support for row-level insert and delete for Hive ACID tables, and
product tests that verify that row-level insert and delete where allowed.

Here is the SQL that we ran in the INSERT/DELETE demo
```
/*
  Ran against Presto
*/
SHOW SCHEMAS IN minio;
SHOW TABLES IN minio.acid;

CREATE SCHEMA minio.acid
WITH (location = 's3a://acid/');


CREATE TABLE minio.acid.test (a int, b int)
WITH (
   format='ORC',
   transactional=true
);

INSERT INTO minio.acid.test VALUES (10, 10), (20, 20);

SELECT * FROM  minio.acid.test;

DELETE FROM minio.acid.test WHERE a = 10;

/*
  Ran against Hive
*/

SHOW DATABASES;

SELECT * FROM acid.test;
```

David also mentioned [this blog](http://shzhangji.com/blog/2019/06/10/understanding-hive-acid-transactional-table/)
to better understand the hive acid model.

In this week's question we answer, “Why is Java 11 needed in the newer version
of Presto and how do I get the older version of Presto as I need the 328 latest 
on Java 8 as Java 11 isn’t available to use?

Using Java 11 because it is the next LTS verison of java since 8. Java 11 
provides significant performance and stability improvements, so we believe 
everyone should be running that version to get the best experience out of 
Presto. Moving to Java 11 allows us to take advantage of many improvements to 
the JDK and the Java language that were introduced since Java 8.

For older versions, you can download it from maven or an older document version.
<https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/prestosql/presto-server/>
<{{site.url}}/docs/328/>

One thing to point out is you're only required to use JDK11 for the server. The
client can be on JDK8. One reason you would need to run Presto on JDK8 is if the
server had to be run with another service running JDK8 which we do not recommend
as this will degrade the performance of your cluster and could cause other
issues if Presto is fighting for resources. 

Another possibility is that there is
a company policy requiring specific JDKs be installed on all servers. You can
have side-by-side installs of multiple versions of the JDK and use the
appropriate one. You just need to launch Presto with the correct java command. 
If your company is against using a newer JDK, you can point out the arguments
above to update the policy to at least include JDK11.
