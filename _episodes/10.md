## Release 352
Release Notes discussed: <https://trino.io/docs/current/release/release-352.html>
At the time of recording 352 was not out yet. We will discuss a few of the
 changes coming down the pipeline to look forward to!

## Naming our new bunny!
That's right, you submitted your names, and we are now happy to announce the top
names that were chosen, and we will choose the name by a community poll.

</p>

The running names are:

 - Lepi: short for Lepus, the constellation under Orion that is in the shape of
 a bunny and said to be chased by Orion or Orion's dogs. They cannot catch it
  because the bunny is fast <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepus_(constellation)>.
 - Neut: early name used by community members through hearsay to unofficially 
 name the bunny until it had a real name. This name, which is a portmanteau when
  combined with Trino (Neut-Trino) became popular among a few members.
 - Nu: math symbol, with a similar prefix use of Nu + Trino to refer to
  the neutrino origins. Also in physics nu represents any of three kinds of
  neutrino in particle physics. 
 - Commander Bun Bun:  a name suggested by a community member's child who loves 
 the bunny!
